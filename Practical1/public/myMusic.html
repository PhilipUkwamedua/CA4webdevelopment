<h1>My taste in music</h1>
<p>Soul music is a popular music genre that originated in the African American community throughout the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s.<br>
<p> It has its roots in African-American gospel music and rhythm and blues.<br>
<p>Soul music became popular for dancing and listening, where U.S. record labels such as Motown, Atlantic and Stax were influential during the Civil Rights Movement.<br>
<p> Soul also became popular around the world, directly influencing rock music and the music of Africa. It also had a resurgence with artists like Erykah Badu under the genre neo-soul.</p>
